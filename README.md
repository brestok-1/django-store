I made this django project to explore new technologies and libraries, as well as hone my docker containerization skill.
In this project, I have collected the most popular and necessary tools for creating complex and full-fledged projects.

## Description

<br/>

This is one of the most complex Django projects that I have implemented to date. I created an online store where you can
log in through social networks or register, receive email confirmation letters, purchase various products, sort them by
categories, and then pay through the Stripe system. You can also see a list of all your orders and their status. This is
a fully functional and ready-to-use online store.

Since I position myself as a backend developer, I focused on the internal components, not the appearance of the
site.
